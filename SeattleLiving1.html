            <p>From that <a href = "http://www.starbucks.com/Starbucks">Starbucks</a> down the street to the first Starbucks ever down at the stunning <a href = "http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike">Pike Place Market</a>, Seattle is full of Starbucks. Seattle is also full of Starbucks wannabe's, so if you don't get that job at Starbucks, chances are there's a nearby coffee shop with a job for you. </p>
