            Capital Hill
          </h4>
          <article>
            Capital Hill's population of about 35,000 has been centered around the Seattle music scene for the last several decades. In recent years, the neighborhood has become more gentrified as luxury highrises knock down "grungy" older walk-up apartments and put up apartments 2-3 times more expensive than just a decade ago. More "affordable" units are becoming progressively smaller in size, which can effect quality of living. Parking is some of the most expensive and hardest to find in the city, with the exception of the downtown core. That said, with all the new public transportation options, driving should be ones last desired mode of transportation if living on the Hill.

            Belltown
          </h4>
          <article>
            Situated right along Seattle's waterfront, Belltown is the city's most densely populated neighborhood, and is home to some of its most popular restaurants, vibrant nightlife, and a multitude of residential options. Olympic Sculpture Park and Myrtle Edwards Park, which offer beautiful, panoramic ocean/mountain views, are both just a short walk away, as are a number of unique shops and boutiques. The Pier is also close by, along with other attractions such as the Seattle Aquarium and the Great Wheel. Housing options include a variety of apartments and condos available for rent or sale.

            U-District
          </h4>
          <article>
            So named because of its close proximity to the University of Washington, the U-District offers the practicality and walkability that comes along with living near a major university, but still allows its residents to retreat to a nice home in a quiet neighborhood in the area surrounding campus. There are many single-family homes around, or, if you're a true city-dweller and don't mind the occasional car horn or wave of college students running to class, you can choose from a variety of apartments or condos available near "The Ave", locals' nickname for nearby University Way.

          Ballard
          </h4>
          <article>
            As traffic becomes more congested and high-rises continue to crowd
           the city center, some are looking to Ballard for a reprieve from all
           the congestion.  While clean sidewalks, a small town vibe (more
           SFR homes), and some of the best rated public schools in the city
           are enough to entice many to the area- you better drive a car if you
           plan on living in this neighborhood.  There's really no quick way to
           Ballard.  Best case scenario it is a 20+ minute drive from Capital
           Hill or downtown.  Rent and parking is substantially less expensive
           here, but it really is almost it's own little suburb.

          Georgetown
          </h4>
          <article>
            Georgetown is Seattle's first and oldest neighborhood. It is comprised mostly of blue collar business and older single family homes and is also now becoming more developed as many of Seattle's old industrial warehouses are converted to high end luxury loft accomodations- usually over $2,000 a month for a small 1 bedroom. This neighborhood is home to several older motels that are home to a number of successful hard narcotics dealers, pimps and prostitutes. Because most of the neighborhood is dual zoned and the DOT has staging spaces for semi trucks down here, transient RV campers can effectively stay for free while often littering all over the streets as they frequent the above mentioned businesses operating out of the skeezy motels. There are awesome bars and some great restaruants here. If you're considering this neighborhood, you should appreciate the grungy and grittier side of life.
